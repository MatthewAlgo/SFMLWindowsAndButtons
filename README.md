# Matthew's Build System
# Inspired From ModernCppStarter

https://github.com/MatthewAlgo/ModernCppStarter

Supports doc generation, library compilation, integrated package manager (CPM), unit testing.
Run the bash scripts to execute your code. The structure uses CMake.
I have adapted it to easier compile and link libraries and executables.
